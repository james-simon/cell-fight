Do you want to see four ameobas fight like gladiators for your amusement?
This is the library for you.
Do you want to go pseudopod-to-pseudopod with a friend?
Look no further!
Do you want code that is fast, efficient, well-maintained and written in Python?
This code is indeed one of these things.

This was a fairly quick project, so I haven't made it super fast or accessible, but it should run out of the box (ca. 2022).
To use it, install `pygame` and run `main.py`.
The default game has one player-controlled cell and three CPUs.
The player moves their cell with the arrow keys and fires with space bar.
These settings can be changed by editing `main.py`.
